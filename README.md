# What is a DDoS Attack?
A Distributable Denied-of-Service (DDOS) attack server that cuts off targets or surrounding infrastructure in a flood of Internet traffic

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness using multiple compromised computer systems as a source of attack traffic. Search engines may include computers and other network resources such as IoT devices.
From a higher level, the DDOS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam stuck on a highway, preventing regular traffic from reaching its destination.

## NOTE (Please, make sure you have installed python 3 )

## DD0S Career Infection
Recent examples of DDoS attacks include the record-breaking DDoS attack on code repository Github a while ago. GitHub was taken offline for about 10 minutes by an attack that peaked at 1.35Tbps. That record did not last very long, because only one week after GitHub was knocked offline by the world’s largest distributed denial-of-service attack, the same technique was used to direct an even bigger attack against an unnamed US service provider. According to DDoS protection outfit Arbor Networks, that US service provider survived an attack that reached an unprecedented 1.7Tbps.

These attacks use Internet-facing, Memcached-enabled servers to amplify their magnitude. While Memcached servers should technically not be left exposed to the Internet, there are so many of them that are exposed that this vulnerability will be available to attackers for some time to come. 

## For Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions
To use the application, type in the following commands in GNU/Linux terminal.

`sudo apt install git`
`clone`
`cd DDoS-Ripper`
`$ ls`
`$ python3 DRipper.py` OR `python2 DRipper.py`

## For Windows

`clone`

`cd DDoS-Ripper`
` ls`

`python3 DRipper.py` OR `python DRipper.py`

`python3 DRipper.py -s [ip Address] -t 135`

`example: python3 DRipper.py -s 0.00.00.00 -t 135`

## For MacOS

Install Brew and Install dependencies (python 3)
