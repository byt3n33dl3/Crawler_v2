Example Script Enhancement

To incorporate some of these advanced techniques into a script, you could add options for selecting attack modes, specifying rules, or setting custom masks. It's also helpful to include comments explaining each option for future reference.
Learning and Experimenting

The best way to master these advanced options is by experimenting with them. The Hashcat documentation and forums are excellent resources for learning and troubleshooting. Remember, the effectiveness of your attacks largely depends on understanding the behavior and patterns of target passwords, so practice and observation are key.

Always use Hashcat and these techniques ethically and with permission on networks and systems you're authorized to test.
